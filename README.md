# I-am-Bot
Chatbot to elaborate on the life of JM Wesierski
To further my career into the study of artificial intelligence I have decided to develope a chatbot.
I have not yet decided on the extent to how personal this bot will be, because this project is for a class in order to satisfy an I am project.
I will be using meya.ai's SDK and API. They were the best option because of their versatility of their kit as well as their ability to host the bot.
I do not want to create website for this rudimentary task, and will be hosting it through codepen.
Link: TBD
